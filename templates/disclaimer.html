<h2>PARTICIPANT INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>GReaT-RbAM : Generated Reasoning Traces for Relation-based Argument Mining</h3>

<u>Principal Investigator:</u> Abdurrahman SEN
</br>
<u>Supervisors:</u> Dr. Bruno YUN, Dr. Frédéric ARMETTA
</br></br>
I am Abdurrahman SEN, an MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.  I would like to invite you to participate in the research project "GReaT-RbAM" – Generated Reasoning Traces for Relation-based Argument Mining.  Below is some information about the project to help you decide whether you would like to participate.
</br></br>
Participation in the research project is completely voluntary.  You can withdraw from the project at any time without providing a reason.

<h3>Goals</h3>
The goal of this research is to improve the understanding of how reasoning traces generated by large reasoning models (LRMs) can be used to enhance the interpretation and predictions of argument relationships in pairs of argumentative sentences.
</br></br>

The aim of this experiment is to collect human annotations on the relationships between pairs of arguments, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of reasoning traces generated by large reasoning models (LRMs).

<h3>What you will be tasked to perform</h3>
You will be presented with a pair of arguments and tasked to evaluate the relationship between them. It can be either "<strong style="color: #28a745">Support</strong>", "<strong style="color: #dc3545">Attack</strong>" or "<strong style="color: #6c757d">Neutral</strong>". </br>
You will need to indicate your confidence in your choice, from Low to High.</br>
Each pair will be presented twice:
<ol>
    <li>First, only the arguments will be presented;</li>
    <li>Second, the arguments will be presented along with the reasoning traces generated by a large reasoning model (LRM).</li>
</ol>
In the latter case, you will also be asked to rate the clarity and helpfulness of the reasoning traces on a scale from 1 to 5. An optional <i>comment</i> field is provided if you have any doubts about the reasoning traces.</br>
No personal information will be collected at any time.

<h3>Time commitment</h3>
You will be asked to annotate 21 pairs of arguments twice, for a total of 42 annotations, which should take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours.</br>
You can complete the questionnaire in multiple sessions, as your <b>progress will be saved in a cookie</b>. If you clear your cookies, you will lose your progress and have to start over.</br>
We use a cookie to save your progress so that you may leave and resume without needing user authentication. </br>
The only data saved to this cookie is a unique ID, the ID of the last question shown and whether you have already completed this survey. </br>
We plan to publish this survey for approximately one month starting July 25th, 2025. This survey can be accessed from any computer with an internet connection. It can also be accessed from a mobile phone, but it is recommended to use a computer for a better experience.</br>

<h3>Risks</h3>
There should not be any risks to you from the experiment. You can also withdraw from the assessment at any time.

<h3>Data management and storage</h3>
The data collected will be stored on our own server, and completely anonymized under a unique random identifier. No personal information will be recorded at any time. The nature of the questions will not allow any retrospective identification of participants.

<h3>Consent</h3>
Your consent is implied by your agreement to participate in this research.

<h3>Sponsors</h3>
There are no sponsors for this research.</br>
Thank you for considering participation in this research.</br></br>
