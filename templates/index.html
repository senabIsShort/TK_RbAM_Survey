  <h2>Evaluate the relationship from the SOURCE to the TARGET arguments.</h2>
  <p>As part of our research, you'll be tasked to annotate the relationship from one argument to the other. This relationship can be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong style="color: #28a745">Support</strong>: The source argument supports the target argument by either providing an example, a fact or a conclusion similar to it.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: #dc3545">Attack</strong>: The source argument attacks the target argument by either providing counterexamples, counterfacts or a conclusion that contradicts it.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: #6c757d">Neutral</strong>: The source argument is unrelated to the target argument, it may be discussing a completely different topic or does not either attack or support its claims.</li>
  </ul>
