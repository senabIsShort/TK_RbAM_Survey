<h2>About GReaT-RbAM</h2>
<p>
    GReaT-RbAM (Generated Reasoning Traces for Relation-based Argument Mining) is a dataset aiming to augment the context of any given pair of argumentative sentences with reasoning traces generated by an LRM. </br>
    This survey aims to collect human annotations on the relationships between pairs of arguments, with the goal of evaluating the effectiveness of these generated reasoning traces and their usefulness in annotation interpretation.
